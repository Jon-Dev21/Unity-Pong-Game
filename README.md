# Unity-Pong-Game
A 2D pong game using Unity and C#.

This pong game was created with the help of the Section 19 - Building the Game Pong Clone of the Complete C# Masterclass course in Udemy.
Further changes to this game will be pushed into this repository.

Future plans include: 
- Creating an options section
- Sound when hovering on play button
- The option to decide if player is an AI or a human Player
- Ability to change player names
- Ability to set customize points to goal
- Ability to customize racket and ball speed and max speed.
- Much more

## Disclamer
The Game Over music is a mix of clips and contains explicit language. 
This was done for comical purposes.
